# Backup Security Configuration
# Important: The password hash is used to protect validator backups
# To generate a password hash:
# 1. Choose a strong password (at least 8 characters)
# 2. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters
# 3. Store the password safely - you'll need it to decrypt backups
# 4. Never share your backup password with anyone
# 5. The actual password should NEVER be stored in any configuration file
BACKUP_PASSWORD_HASH=your_password_hash_here  # Will be automatically set when first backup is created

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the values with your actual configuration
# 3. Make sure to keep .env file secure and never commit it to version control
# 4. For the backup password, you will be prompted when creating your first backup
# 5. The password hash will be automatically saved in your .env file

# Security Notes:
# - BOT_TOKEN: Get this from @BotFather on Telegram
# - ADMIN_ID: Your Telegram user ID (get it from @userinfobot)
# - SERVER_PORT: Your node's RPC port (default: 26657)
# - BACKUP_PASSWORD_HASH: Will be set automatically, do not set manually
# - Keep your backup password safe - it's required to restore backups
# - Use a password manager to store your backup password securely
# - Regular backups are recommended for validator security
